# HTML Element Overview

A short overview of all HTML elements sorted by their function in the DOM. Take a look at it on [elements.borger.io](https://elements.borger.io/).

The overview is based on the [MDN HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and their [mdn-browser-compat-data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data) Github repo.

`/client` is the websites frontend and `/server` the API.
